### Dry Run of `primeSubOperation`

#### **Code Overview:**
1. **`sieve` method:**  
   Generates a boolean array `isprime` where `isprime[i]` is `true` if `i` is prime.
  
2. **`primeSubOperation` method:**  
   Adjusts the array `nums` by subtracting primes to ensure the array remains strictly increasing from right to left.

### **Step-by-Step Dry Run**

**Input:**  
```plaintext
nums = [10, 8, 6]
```

---

#### **Step 1: Sieve Initialization**
- **Initialize `isprime` to `true` for all indices:**
  
  - After marking `0` and `1` as `false`, apply the sieve algorithm:
  
  | Prime \(i\) | Marked as Non-prime |
  |-------------|---------------------|
  | 2           | 4, 6, 8, 10, ...    |
  | 3           | 9, 12, 15, ...      |
  | 5           | 25, 30, ...         |
  | 7           | 49, 56, ...         |
  
- Final primes under `1000` include:
  \[
  2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, \dots
  \]

---

#### **Step 2: Loop through `nums` from Right to Left**

**`i = 1`: Compare `nums[1] = 8` and `nums[2] = 6`**  
- `nums[1] >= nums[2]` → Need to reduce `nums[1]`.  
- **Subtract primes from `nums[1] = 8`:**
  - \(8 - 2 = 6\) (not valid as \(6 \geq 6\))  
  - \(8 - 3 = 5\) (valid since \(5 < 6\))  
  - Update: `nums[1] = 5`

**`i = 0`: Compare `nums[0] = 10` and `nums[1] = 5`**  
- `nums[0] >= nums[1]` → Need to reduce `nums[0]`.  
- **Subtract primes from `nums[0] = 10`:**
  - \(10 - 2 = 8\) (not valid as \(8 \geq 5\))  
  - \(10 - 3 = 7\) (valid since \(7 < 5\))  
  - Update: `nums[0] = 7`

After processing:  
\[
nums = [7, 5, 6]
\]

**Conclusion:** The array remains valid and strictly increasing.  
Return: **`true`**

### **Final Output**

true
```
